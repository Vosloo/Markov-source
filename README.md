# Text approximation using Markov-source

Generating an approximation of the English language text using k-order Markov Source.

K-order Markov source is an approximation of a text in which probability of the next character depends on the 'k' previous characters.<br>
For fully random generated sequences, first 'k - 1' characters are created using i-order Markov Source for 'i' in [0; k - 1] range.
